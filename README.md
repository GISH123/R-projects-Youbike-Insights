Uses ggmap package to plot on the google map(Taiwan)

# netflow plot   *主要重點* 詳細看netflow資料夾
plot netflow with animations(by time)


# avg_time_plot
plot avg time per station

# lat_and_long 站點名稱經緯度轉換  
ggmap needs latitude and longitude to plot, so we need to get each station's lat and long first
my lat_and_long.R does that
