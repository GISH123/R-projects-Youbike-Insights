## My part of the project:

# R-projects-Youbike-Insights
Uses 2016/1 Youbike data,trying to know the insights of deploying the youbike bicycles OR knowing the revenues from each station

Uses ggmap package to plot on the google map(Taiwan)

# netflow plot   *主要重點* 詳細看netflow資料夾
plot netflow with animations(by time)


# avg_time_plot
plot avg time per station

# lat_and_long 站點名稱經緯度轉換  
ggmap needs latitude and longitude to plot, so we need to get each station's lat and long first  

my lat_and_long.R does that
