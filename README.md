## My part of the project:

# R-projects-Youbike-Insights
Uses 2016/1 Youbike data,trying to know the insights of deploying the youbike bicycles OR knowing the revenues from each station

Uses ggmap package to plot on the google map(Taiwan)

# netflow plot   *Main Deliverable* 詳細看netflow資料夾 動態顯示每天站點淨流量變化
Uses ggmap and gganimate function to show the netflow of stations by time(day)


# avg_time_plot
plot avg time per station

# lat_and_long 站點名稱經緯度轉換  
ggmap needs latitude and longitude to plot, so we need to get each station's lat and long first.

My lat_and_long.R does that.
